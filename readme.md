# Record Player

A real player that plays fake records.

This is [Owntone](https://owntone.github.io/owntone-server/) media server in retro-style body. It plays local files and streams Spotify to local speakers or Apple HomePods. Disks are NFC tags. A Python application connects the NFC reader, LED lights, input controls, and controls Owntone using its RESTful API. Everything is running on a headless Raspberry Pi with a little help from a CircuitPython development board. And a small motor inside spins a disk.
